Hello, I'm Lauren! 👋🏼 I am a recent graduate of the University of British Columbia's Master of Data Science program. Passionate about harnessing AI to make meaningful impacts, I have been involved in projects as a ML developer in the fields of healthcare, transcriptomics and mining. I am currently seeking new grad opportunities in machine learning engineering and data science for Winter 2024.

In my spare time, you'll find me catching up with the latest cinema 📽️, gushing over DIY manicures 💅🏼 and researching new restaurants 🍜.
